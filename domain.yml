  - text: If you’ve been awake for more than 20 minutes, get out of bed and do a quiet,
      non-stimulating activity, such as reading a book. Keep the lights dim and avoid
      screens so as not to cue your body that it’s time to wake up.

      feels in the moment. Allow thoughts and emotions to come and go without judgment,
      always returning to focus on breath and your body

      your nose and out through your mouth
